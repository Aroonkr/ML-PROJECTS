TV Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict TV sales based on various features such as advertising expenditure, price, and seasonality. The dataset used for this project was obtained from a marketing research company and contains information on TV sales and advertising expenditure for multiple regions.
Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the data folder. It contains the following columns:

    Region: The region where the sales were made.
    Sales: The number of TV sales made.
    Advertising: The advertising expenditure in that region.
    Price: The price of the TVs in that region.
    Season: The season during which the sales were made.

Methodology

The project was developed using Python programming language and various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and Pandas. Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the relationships between the different features and the target variable.

Afterward, a multiple linear regression model was developed to predict TV sales based on advertising expenditure, price, and seasonality. The model was trained on the dataset using the scikit-learn library and evaluated using various performance metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.
Results

The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.87, indicating a good fit to the data. The mean absolute error and root mean squared error were 2.4 and 3.7, respectively, indicating that the model has low prediction errors.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting sales based on various features. The developed model can be used by marketing research companies to predict TV sales based on advertising expenditure, price, and seasonality.
