# Vehicle dataset
 This dataset contains information about various vehicles and their attributes such as car name, selling price, transmission type, and kilometers driven.
 
 Data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv 

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `car_name`: The name of the car
- `selling_price`: The price at which the car is being sold
- `transmission`: The type of transmission (Automatic/Manual)
- `kms_driven`: The number of kilometers driven by the car

## Model Selection

We use cross-validation to find the best model for predicting the selling price of a vehicle based on its attributes. This helps us to select a model that generalizes well to new data.
